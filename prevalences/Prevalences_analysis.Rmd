## Descriptive Statistics

We provide basic descriptive statistics of the included studies, without excluding any data due to missingness.

  Value       = format(c(NROW(df_moderation),

## 🚀 Low Symptom Trajectory

### Descriptives

We provide additional descriptives based on the Low trajectory variable, using the full dataset.

```{r Low-descriptives}

# Copy the dataset to avoid overwriting the original
df_low <- df_moderation

# Calculate Low_n as (percentage / 100) * sample size
df_low$Low_n <- round((df_low$Low_percentage / 100) * df_low$Sample_Size)

# Total number of individuals classified as Low (ignoring missingness in other variables)
total_Low_n <- sum(df_low$Low_n, na.rm = TRUE)

# Number of unique studies (assumes a column Study exists)
unique_Low_studies <- length(unique(df_low$Study[!is.na(df_low$Low_percentage)]))

# Display as a table
additional_info <- data.frame(
  Description = c("Total number of individuals in Low trajectory", "Number of unique studies"),
  Value = format(c(total_Low_n, unique_Low_studies), big.mark = ",")
)

knitr::kable(additional_info, caption = "Additional Descriptives for Low Trajectory Analysis")
```

### Generic GLMM results

We estimate the pooled prevalence of the **Low trajectory** using a Generalized Linear Mixed Model (GLMM).\
No data is removed from the dataset; the `rma.glmm()` function handles missingness internally.


```{r Low-glmm}
Low_summary <- fit_glmm_prev(df_low, event_col = "Low_n", n_col = "Sample_Size",
                             label = "Low Symptoms Trajectory")

knitr::kable(Low_summary, caption = "Pooled Prevalence Estimate for Low Trajectory (GLMM)")
```

### Sensitivity Analysis 1

Excluding studies with Low trajectory ≥90%

```{r Low-sensitivity_1}
sens1_df <- subset(df_low,
                   !is.na(Low_n) & !is.na(Sample_Size) &
                   !is.na(Low_percentage) & Low_percentage < 90)
sens1 <- fit_glmm_prev(sens1_df, "Low_n", "Sample_Size", "Sensitivity 1: Exclude ≥90% Low")
knitr::kable(sens1, caption = "Sensitivity Analysis 1: Low Trajectory (Excl. ≥90% Prevalence)")
```

### Sensitivity Analysis 2

Including only large samples (N \> 999)

```{r Low-sensitivity-2}
sens2_df <- subset(df_low,
                   !is.na(Low_n) & !is.na(Sample_Size) &
                   Sample_Size > 999)
sens2 <- fit_glmm_prev(sens2_df, "Low_n", "Sample_Size", "Sensitivity 2: N > 999")
knitr::kable(sens2, caption = "Sensitivity Analysis 2: Low Trajectory (Samples > 999)")
```

### Sensitivity Analysis 3

Exclude Influential Studies: We conducted an influence analysis to identify studies with disproportionate impact on the pooled estimate using Cook's distance from a glmer model.

```{r Low-influential}

# Fit a GLMM with glmer (binomial model with random study effect)
model_glmer_Low <- glmer(cbind(round(Low_n), Sample_Size - round(Low_n)) ~ 1 + (1 | Study),
                     data = df_low,
                     family = binomial)

# Run influence analysis by Study
infl <- influence(model_glmer_Low, group = "Study")

# Compute Cook's distance
cooks <- cooks.distance(infl)

# Define rule-of-thumb threshold
threshold <- 4 / length(cooks)

# Plot Cook's distances
p1 <- plot(cooks, type = "h", lwd = 2,
     main = "Cook's Distance per Study",
     ylab = "Cook's Distance", xlab = "Study Index")
abline(h = threshold, col = "red", lty = 2)


# Identify studies above the threshold
influential_indices <- which(cooks > threshold)
influential_studies <- unique(df_low$Study[influential_indices])

# Display studies
influential_table <- data.frame(
  Study_ID = influential_studies,
  Cooks_Distance = round(cooks[influential_indices], 3)
)

knitr::kable(influential_table, caption = "Studies Identified as Influential (Cook's Distance)")
```

We reran the GLMM excluding the identified influential studies.

```{r Low-sens-influential}
df_excl <- if (nrow(influential_table)) df_low[ !(df_low$Study %in% influential_table$Study_ID), ] else df_low
sens_infl <- fit_glmm_prev(df_excl, "Low_n", "Sample_Size",
                           "Sensitivity 3: Excluding Influential Studies")
knitr::kable(sens_infl, caption = "Sensitivity Analysis 3: Low Trajectory (Excluding Influential Studies)")
```

### Use `glmer` estimate

with the glmer\`-based intercept estimate:

```{r Low-glmer-summary}
# Intercept estimate & SE (logit scale)
sm <- coef(summary(model_glmer_Low))["(Intercept)", ]

# 95% CI on logit scale (fast Wald CI, avoids slow profiling)
ci <- suppressMessages(confint(model_glmer_Low, parm = "(Intercept)", method = "Wald"))

# Count of studies used in the model
k_study <- nlevels(lme4::getME(model_glmer_Low, "flist")$Study)

# Tidy summary on proportion scale
glmer_summary_Low <- data.frame(
  Model             = "glmer (binomial, random intercept)",
  Pooled_Prevalence = round(plogis(sm["Estimate"]), 3),
  CI_Lower          = round(plogis(ci[1]), 3),
  CI_Upper          = round(plogis(ci[2]), 3),
  Studies_included  = k_study,
  check.names = FALSE
)

knitr::kable(glmer_summary_Low, caption = "Low Trajectory Estimate from glmer Model")
```

**Note on Number of Studies Included** The number of studies included in the models may differ between rma.glmm() and glmer(). This is expected because the two methods handle data slightly differently:

rma.glmm() is designed for meta-analysis and accepts aggregated data (events + sample size). It applies continuity corrections directly and may include more studies when appropriate.

glmer() is a general GLMM function. It uses binomial counts and handles missingness or zero counts differently. Studies with no variance or missing outcomes may be excluded automatically.

Both approaches are valid, but they may produce slightly different sample sizes. We report both transparently for completeness.

## 🌿 Decreasing Symptom Trajectory

### Descriptives

We provide additional descriptives based on the Decreasing trajectory variable, using the full dataset.

```{r High-glmm}
High_summary <- fit_glmm_prev(df_High, event_col = "High_n", n_col = "Sample_Size",
                             label = "High Symptoms Trajectory")

knitr::kable(High_summary, caption = "Pooled Prevalence Estimate for High Trajectory (GLMM)")
```

### Sensitivity Analysis 1

Excluding studies with High trajectory ≥90%

```{r High-sensitivity_1}
sens1_df <- subset(df_High,
                   !is.na(High_n) & !is.na(Sample_Size) &
                     !is.na(High_percentage) & High_percentage < 90)
sens1 <- fit_glmm_prev(sens1_df, "High_n", "Sample_Size", "Sensitivity 1: Exclude ≥90% High")
knitr::kable(sens1, caption = "Sensitivity Analysis 1: High Trajectory (Excl. ≥90% Prevalence)")
```

### Sensitivity Analysis 2

Including only large samples (N \> 999)

```{r High-sensitivity-2}
sens2_df <- subset(df_High,
                   !is.na(High_n) & !is.na(Sample_Size) &
                     Sample_Size > 999)
sens2 <- fit_glmm_prev(sens2_df, "High_n", "Sample_Size", "Sensitivity 2: N > 999")
knitr::kable(sens2, caption = "Sensitivity Analysis 2: High Trajectory (Samples > 999)")
```

### Sensitivity Analysis 3

Exclude Influential Studies: We conducted an influence analysis to identify studies with disproportionate impact on the pooled estimate using Cook's distance from a glmer model.

```{r High-influential}

# Fit a GLMM with glmer (binomial model with random study effect)
model_glmer_High <- glmer(cbind(round(High_n), Sample_Size - round(High_n)) ~ 1 + (1 | Study),
                     data = df_High,
                     family = binomial)

# Run influence analysis by Study
infl <- influence(model_glmer_High, group = "Study")

# Compute Cook's distance
cooks <- cooks.distance(infl)

# Define rule-of-thumb threshold
threshold <- 4 / length(cooks)

# Plot Cook's distances
p1 <- plot(cooks, type = "h", lwd = 2,
           main = "Cook's Distance per Study",
           ylab = "Cook's Distance", xlab = "Study Index")
abline(h = threshold, col = "red", lty = 2)


# Identify studies above the threshold
influential_indices <- which(cooks > threshold)
influential_studies <- unique(df_High$Study[influential_indices])

# Display studies
influential_table <- data.frame(
  Study_ID = influential_studies,
  Cooks_Distance = round(cooks[influential_indices], 3)
)

knitr::kable(influential_table, caption = "Studies Identified as Influential (Cook's Distance)")
```

We reran the GLMM excluding the identified influential studies.

```{r High-sens-influential}
df_excl <- if (nrow(influential_table)) df_High[ !(df_High$Study %in% influential_table$Study_ID), ] else df_High
sens_infl <- fit_glmm_prev(df_excl, "High_n", "Sample_Size",
                           "Sensitivity 3: Excluding Influential Studies")
knitr::kable(sens_infl, caption = "Sensitivity Analysis 3: High Trajectory (Excluding Influential Studies)")
```

### Use `glmer` estimate

with the glmer\`-based intercept estimate:
  
```{r High-glmer-summary}
# Intercept estimate & SE (logit scale)
sm <- coef(summary(model_glmer_High))["(Intercept)", ]

# 95% CI on logit scale (fast Wald CI, avoids sHigh profiling)
ci <- suppressMessages(confint(model_glmer_High, parm = "(Intercept)", method = "Wald"))

# Count of studies used in the model
k_study <- nlevels(lme4::getME(model_glmer_High, "flist")$Study)

# Tidy summary on proportion scale
glmer_summary_High <- data.frame(
  Model             = "glmer (binomial, random intercept)",
  Pooled_Prevalence = round(plogis(sm["Estimate"]), 3),
  CI_Higher          = round(plogis(ci[1]), 3),
  CI_Upper          = round(plogis(ci[2]), 3),
  Studies_included  = k_study,
  check.names = FALSE
)

knitr::kable(glmer_summary_High, caption = "High Trajectory Estimate from glmer Model")
```

**Note on Number of Studies Included** The number of studies included in the models may differ between rma.glmm() and glmer(). This is expected because the two methods handle data slightly differently:
  
  rma.glmm() is designed for meta-analysis and accepts aggregated data (events + sample size). It applies continuity corrections directly and may include more studies when appropriate.

glmer() is a general GLMM function. It uses binomial counts and handles missingness or zero counts differently. Studies with no variance or missing outcomes may be excluded automatically.

Both approaches are valid, but they may produce slightly different sample sizes. We report both transparently for completeness.

## 🌗 Moderate Symptom Trajectory

### Descriptives

We provide additional descriptives based on the Moderate trajectory variable, using the full dataset.

```{r Moderate-descriptives}

# Copy the dataset to avoid overwriting the original
df_Moderate <- df_moderation

# Calculate Moderate_n as (percentage / 100) * sample size
df_Moderate$Moderate_n <- round((df_Moderate$Moderate_percentage / 100) * df_Moderate$Sample_Size)

# Total number of individuals classified as Moderate (ignoring missingness in other variables)
total_Moderate_n <- sum(df_Moderate$Moderate_n, na.rm = TRUE)

# Number of unique studies (assumes a column Study exists)
unique_Moderate_studies <- length(unique(df_Moderate$Study[!is.na(df_Moderate$Moderate_percentage)]))

# Display as a table
additional_info <- data.frame(
  Description = c("Total number of individuals in Moderate trajectory", "Number of unique studies"),
  Value = format(c(total_Moderate_n, unique_Moderate_studies), big.mark = ",")
)

knitr::kable(additional_info, caption = "Additional Descriptives for Moderate Trajectory Analysis")
```

### Generic GLMM results

We estimate the pooled prevalence of the **Moderate trajectory** using a Generalized Linear Mixed Model (GLMM).\
No data is removed from the dataset; the `rma.glmm()` function handles missingness internally.


```{r Moderate-glmm}

                             label = "Moderate Symptoms Trajectory")
